# Windows Installation

## Warnings ⚠️
This is **NOT** an official Windows port by AYN, nor does AYN provides support for this custom port.

This is a community effort project, and thus we cannot guarantee no issues when attempting to install this port on your Odin.

Additionally, install this port might void any warranty that is currently active for your device.

You are 100% responsible of installing this, and we are not responsible if your Odin bricks.
